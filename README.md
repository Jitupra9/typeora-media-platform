# 🌐 Typeora – Real-Time Incident & Opinion Sharing Platform

## 🏁 Project Goal

**Typeora** is a full-stack web application developed to **store, document, and share real-time and past incidents** — including **criminal activities, accidents, and other important social events**. It enables individuals, communities, and organizations to post articles, share videos, go live, and express their opinions around these events. The aim is to build awareness, enable discussion, and preserve critical information that can be used for personal, legal, or historical purposes.

## ✨ Features

- 📝 **Post Articles** – Users can create and publish detailed writeups describing real-time or past incidents such as criminal cases, accidents, protests, or social movements. Each article can include titles, tags, and locations for better visibility and classification.

- 📹 **Upload Videos** – Users can upload video footage to provide real-time context, visual evidence, or recordings of incidents. This supports building stronger awareness and allows users to document events visually and securely.

- 🔴 **Go Live** – Users can stream live from the scene of an incident or event. This allows for direct engagement and real-time updates from the ground.

- 💬 **Opinion Sharing** – Alongside every post or video, users can express their personal opinions and reactions. Additionally, Typeora includes a **dedicated "Opinion" section** (similar to Twitter), where users can freely share short thoughts or start public discussions about trending topics or ongoing social issues.

- 🌐 **Create Communities** – Users can form and manage their own communities based on interest areas (e.g., local city, activism, environment). Community admins can moderate posts and grow awareness within their circles.

- 🗃️ **Information Storage** – All articles, videos, and posts are securely stored so users can access them later as **evidence, for research, or personal archiving**. The platform emphasizes keeping a public log of important incidents.

- 🗓️ **Calendar-Based Search** – Typeora includes a **smart calendar filter** that allows users to find incidents based on specific dates. By selecting a date, users can instantly view all posts, videos, and live sessions that happened **around or on that date**, helping them explore contextually grouped data quickly.
